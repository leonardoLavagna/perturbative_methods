# perturbative_methods
Implementations related to the article "Time-Independent Perturbation Theory in One-Dimensional Quantum Systems: A Tutorial for Quantum Computing Practitioners".

## What's in here
Here you can find the companion code of the project.
- `notebooks` contains the solution of some of the problems discussed in the article (e.g. the potential well problem).
-  `utilities` contains auxiliary functions
-  `config.py` is a configuration file associated to some hyperparameters need in some of the problems solved in the `notebooks` directory.
-  `app.py` is a user-friently app freely available at [perturbative-methods-in-action.streamlit.app](https://perturbative-methods-in-action.streamlit.app/) where some of the problems discussed in the article can be visualized an studied interactively.
-  `requirements.txt` contains the requirements needed to run the app.
-  `LICENCE.txt` is a MIT Licence.
